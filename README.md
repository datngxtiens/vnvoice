# Build On, Vietnam 2022 - Team Cloudies
People between the ages of 15-30 are identified as a group that significantly impact promoting the habits of IT usage in society. Moreover, Vietnam is prioritising the implementation of e-government with the motto of people and businesses as the centre. The recent years have seen the considerable impact of policies related to education and career orientation on youngsters from the age of 15 to 30. But in fact, we also see the inability of government to attract young peopleâ€™s participation in voicing their opinions on education policies and career orientation programs. Hence, there needs a platform for the government to identify trends and interests of this group of youngsters. With that view, our team propose a new social platform in which the youngsters can raise their voice about daily issues, ask for consultants and with that the government can record, survey and identify trends and interests among this group, which is the basis for the government to make appropriate policies on education, career orientation and many other problems.
